Title: Real-time Streaming of inter-markets stock price differentials

Causenge Cangin Ph.D.

This project identifies real-life inter-market stock price differentials between the Germany Stock exchange and the London Stock exchange. Cross-listed stocks are generally fungible and more liquid than depository receipts.
Intra-day stock price fluctuation and foreign currency exchange variations often contribute differences of stock prices, because both markets are not kept in perfect alignment at all moments in time. Please see PowerPoint for details of system design.
